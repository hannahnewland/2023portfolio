							<h1>The Designer That I Am:<br / >
							Values.</h1>
							<p><strong>An Essay I wrote for Pathways to Research. </strong></p>

							<h4>Research Review</h4>


							<p>People ignore design that ignores people (Frank Chimero, n.d.). A design can be simple but benefit many - if you are able to positively impact as many people as possible through your designs, I don’t see why you shouldn’t. But how do you describe this as a value, and how can you create a long lasting impression with minimal knowledge of the issue?</p>

							<p>Throughout my research, I’ve found myself aligning a lot of my values with those of co-design. I am taking Co-design I this trimester, and over the short time I’ve been in this course the importance of collaboration and inclusion has become increasingly obvious. K.A McKercher (2020) describes the 4 design principles for co-design - share power, prioritise relationships, use participatory means, and build capability - and emphasises the significance of elevating lived experience throughout your design work. This has encouraged me to realise ensuring you are working each step of the design process with the communities you are designing for establishes diversity within the process. Diverse views help us to find the systemic causes of issues and identify overlooked resources, as well as see old issues in new ways (McKercher, 2020). Speaking about communities instead of with them can lead to designers assuming they understand people’s needs and making impactful, poor decisions. We may confuse our knowledge of providing a service with the experience of receiving said service (McKercher, 2020).</p>

							<p>The communities that social innovators work with often do understand how situations could be improved but may not have the permission, funding, and authority to enact that change (L. Weinstein, 2019). </p>

							<p>According to Karjaluoto (2013), a good design solution should fit the client like a well-tailored suit: It puts emphasis on the wearer (user), not the garment (design) (p. 14/19). Continuing this comparison, a well-tailored suit cannot be made without a great deal of input from the client; you need measurements, several fittings, and their ideas for the design, to name a few insights the client might provide. Hence the significance of collaboration to create inclusivity. If the designer of the suit were to make it based on their assumptions of the client or the client’s community, the client could pick up the suit to find that the pant legs are too long, or the designer created two sleeves and the client only has one arm, for example. Including the client throughout the process can provide the best possible outcome.</p>

                            <p>I often think about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and how working with those most affected by the problems of each goal can be the key to achieving each goal. SDG 1, No Poverty, for example, I believe will not be resolved through problem solving by an upper class person from a western civilization - at least not without constant contribution from and collaboration with the minority groups actually affected by poverty. Sachs, J.D. et al. (2019), describe transformations that can be made to achieve SDGs. Sachs, J.D. et al. state key interventions are designed to be consistent with the leave-no-one-behind principle to ensure that investments in services, infrastructure, and technologies promote equity. Their article emphasises the fact that the SDGs will not be achieved without transformations, and those transformations will not be made without collaboration, inclusion, and equity. I believe this way of thinking can be, and should be, applied to the design process.</p>

                            <h4>Mission Statement</h4>

                            <p>My research has assisted me in defining my values. I am a Pākehā woman who was raised in an upper-middle class household. I carry a huge amount of privilege, and I have been very lucky in life. It is important to me, now more than ever, that I use my privilege to uplift minority voices and elevate lived experience through my design work. I am certainly not in a position to speak for underprivileged groups.</p>

                            <p>I think it is also important to advocate for sustainability and sustainable design. As a young person, we have been left a society that's on track for irreversible damage. It shouldn’t be our responsibility to fix, but it is, so it’s crucial that it’s something that is factored into everyday life. </p>

                            <p>In any design practice I think Collaboration, Inclusivity, Sustainability, Whanaungatanga, and Manaakitanga are crucial. Victoria University of Wellington describes Whanaungatanga as collaboration, and Manaakitanga as to support and respect, [...] enacted through its provision of a welcoming, inclusive learning environment (2021). I believe it’s critical that these design values are implemented because they are pivotal in the formation of a more understanding, equitable future. Conducting my research has allowed me to truly comprehend the impact collaboration and working with communities in a “welcoming, inclusive learning environment” has on creating a positive outcome from the design process. It challenges, according to McKercher (2020), the imbalance of power held by individuals, who make important decisions about others lives, livelihoods, and bodies. </p>

                            <p>I know that I certainly wouldn’t want someone else making important decisions that affect me, so why should I encourage and participate in a practice that does this to others? </p>

                            <p>Throughout this assignment and the beginning of my second year as a design student, it’s become increasingly clear to me what my beliefs as a designer are. There is no reason to speak about other people when you can communicate for them instead - from a position of privilege I think it’s especially important that this is at the forefront of my mind. If I am able to ensure my designs are as accessible and inclusive as possible in order to impact the greatest group of people, why would I choose a simpler route that impacts a fraction of the amount, simply because it’s easier? Inclusive design describes methodologies to create products that understand and enable people of all backgrounds and abilities (A. Joyce, 2022). If I have the opportunity to enable people of all backgrounds and abilities through my design work, I am going to take it.</p>

                            <h4>Reflection</h4>

                            <p>Stratos Innovation Group (2016) says collaboration is more than just tapping into individual knowledge - it’s about discovering the unique and collective perspectives on the systems in which communities live, “which makes it vital to create together”. In my opinion, the aforementioned values are crucial because they promote equity. Equity, a solution for addressing imbalance in the world. Society is ever-growing, and as it becomes more aware of the need to address imbalance, I believe it’s important that there are values in place that are already actively working towards this.</p>

                            <p>I also believe inclusivity is simply the right way to approach design practice. What is the benefit of designing something with a community in mind if it ends up not even working for the community? If you as a designer know how to appeal to as many people as possible through your work, why would you actively choose a different approach? I think when possible, we should be designing for social innovation.</p>

                            <p>I intend to uphold these values in my work by practising some aspects, if not all, of co-design. Now that I have defined my values, I think I will find it easier to keep them at the forefront of my mind as I work. Prior to this, I knew what I stood for as a designer, but I didn’t quite know how to put it into words. Now that I’ve established it, it’s easier for me to verbalise the importance of my values as well. In order to uphold these in my work, I think communication and practice is key - and something I’ll keep in mind throughout the rest of my education, and continue in the future. </p>
