							<p>For the past few years, every time I fly somewhere - both domestic and international - something goes wrong. My flight is delayed or cancelled, my bags take 45 minutes to end up on the carousel, I miss my connecting flight because my first flight was late, or we have to disembark the plane before it even takes off. My friends and family think I’m cursed. As a student in Wellington whose family still lives in Auckland, I fly back and forth at least a couple of times a year - and every single time I do so there’s a problem in one way, shape, or form. Am I actually cursed, or is there a more realistic explanation for all these mishaps?</p>

							<p>According to van den Bergh (2023), “Air NZ reported three years of losses after the Covid-19 pandemic closed international borders to travellers”. Thousands of jobs were cut over those three years, and the total loss sits at about 1.334 billion dollars. However, Air NZ’s “profit has rebounded strongly to $213 million after tax in the six months to December 31” (van den Bergh, 2023), so why are passengers still experiencing challenges every time they fly? Air New Zealand Chief Executive Greg Foran (as cited by Zaki, 2023), claimed “we know we have more work to do to tackle customer concerns like long wait times at our call centres, getting planes to depart and arrive on time, lost baggage and getting refunds back in a timely manner [...] We're very aware that flying is not currently the pain-free experience it should be and getting back into shape is a key priority”. The company is facing the wrath of customers (Olley, 2022).</p>

							<p>Flying post-covid in Aotearoa has several key stakeholders - passengers, staff, and Air New Zealand as a whole. It’s clear to me that Air New Zealand as a whole has the most influence over this system and the current state it’s in as well as having power over the other key stakeholders.</p>

							<p>For a company on the up and up, it seems as if not many changes are actually being made to resolve issues that have been prevalent since the beginning of Covid-19. Problems with the call centres that were being discussed in July 2022 are still prominent almost a year later. Costs are skyrocketing, and Air New Zealand staff seem to be stretching the truth - Air New Zealand chief customer and sales officer Leanne Geraghty said (as cited by Powell, 2022) “while the company worked hard to offer affordable and competitive airfares, comparing one seat on one day was not reflective of its pricing structure.” But Powell (2022) goes on to say “She cited examples of early lead-in fares for domestic flights priced between $59 and $99 - and a one-way flight from Auckland to Honolulu for $378. First Up could not find any $378 airfares between Auckland and Honolulu until next October. The cheapest we could find was $484, with one-way flights costing up to $1482 during the school holidays.” Passengers at Auckland Airport told Powell (2022), “It's really disheartening to see that even though you're paying more for the fares, the service you're getting is absolutely horrendous.”</p>

                            <p>Air New Zealand have publicly acknowledged they have to make changes within the system, and they have a lot of work to do to get customer service back to how it was prior to Covid-19. My research has shown me they’ve known for a long time that the customer service is getting less and less bearable, but no changes have been made to fix it. It’s especially important for them to fix it now that they have the funds to do so - customers and passengers will no longer be lenient because Air New Zealand no longer has the ‘struggling financially’ excuse. Air New Zealand also needs to stop prevaricating to cover for themselves. As cited by Downes (2023), Consumer NZ communications and campaigns manager Jessica Walker said that Air New Zealand “didn’t give passengers “the full picture” about their rights” following the grounding of two planes that affected 150,000 passengers. It’s disappointing to see what was once a well liked airline become a mess of customer service failures and frustrated passengers.</p>

                            <p>In Assignment one I detailed how I believed Collaboration, Inclusivity, Sustainability, Whanaungatanga, and Manaakitanga were critical in any design practice. In a system like this, I believe implementing Manaakitanga and Whanaungatanga is most important. Air New Zealand needs to not only be able to acknowledge the issues within their company, but actually take on board customer feedback and criticism and use that to find solutions for the problems they’re currently facing - hence why collaboration, support, and respect (Whanaungatanga and Manaakitanga) are at the forefront of my values that I believe need to be applied. Passengers and customers should be a higher priority because without customers there's no money, and without money there is no Air New Zealand. The extortionate prices are being put down to people being prepared to pay them - but how long will people be willing to do so? I can only speak for myself but I know I have been on several flights recently that have made me never want to fly with Air New Zealand again. Valuing customers, supporting and respecting them, will make them want to come back another time.</p>

                            <p>I think that yes, Air New Zealand have had a difficult go of it over the last 3 years. But I also think they shouldn’t be a year into their recovery with the same issues as the beginning of Covid. The only true desire I have for this system is that they go back to how they were prior to March 2020 - customers and customer service a top priority. Instead of just telling people they know they have issues they need to fix, they should actually act on them. Listening to their passengers and the feedback they are consistently receiving is what is going to get them back into the position they were 3 years ago, not raising flight prices and making customers spend 6 hours on hold. To answer my own question - no I am not cursed, Air New Zealand just has some work to do. </p>
